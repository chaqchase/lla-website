# Kill Process Plugin

Interactive process manager that lets you search and terminate processes with a powerful fuzzy search interface.

## Features

- **Live Fuzzy Search** - Real-time filtering that updates as you type
- **Full-Screen Terminal UI** - Instant process filtering with interactive display
- **Arrow Key Navigation** - Navigate through filtered results easily
- **Multi-Select Support** - Select multiple processes to terminate
- **Smart Ranking** - Results ordered by fuzzy match score
- **Process Details** - View PID, name, CPU usage, and memory
- **Force Kill Support** - SIGKILL on Unix, `/F` on Windows
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **High Performance** - Handles 1000+ processes efficiently
- **Safety Confirmations** - Confirmation dialogs before terminating

## Installation

The kill_process plugin is included with lla's first-party plugins:

```bash
lla install
```

Or enable it if already installed:

```bash
lla use  # Interactive plugin manager
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Launch the interactive process manager:

```bash
lla plugin kill_process interactive
```

**Controls:**
- Type to filter processes in real-time
- `↑/↓` - Navigate through results
- `Space` - Select/deselect process for termination
- `Enter` - Confirm and kill selected process(es)
- `Esc` - Cancel and exit

### Kill by Pattern

Kill processes matching a name pattern:

```bash
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-name "chrome"
```

With force kill (SIGKILL):

```bash
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-name "chrome" --force
```

### Kill by PID

Terminate a specific process ID:

```bash
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-pid 1234
```

Force kill specific PID:

```bash
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-pid 1234 --force
```

### List All Processes

Display all running processes:

```bash
lla plugin kill_process list
```

## Positional Syntax

Use the shorter positional syntax (v0.5.0+):

```bash
# Interactive mode
lla plugin kill_process interactive

# Kill by name
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-name "node"

# Kill by PID
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-pid 5678
```

## Plugin Aliases

Create a short alias in your config for even faster access:

```toml
# ~/.config/lla/config.toml
[plugin_aliases]
k = "kill_process"
```

Then use:

```bash
lla plugin k interactive
lla plugin k kill-by-name "firefox"
```

## Shortcuts

Create shortcuts for common process management tasks:

```bash
# Interactive process killer
lla shortcut add kill kill_process interactive -d "Kill processes interactively"

# Quick process search
lla shortcut add pkill kill_process kill-by-name -d "Kill process by name"
```

Usage:

```bash
lla kill              # Launch interactive mode
lla pkill "chrome"    # Kill all Chrome processes
```

## Actions Reference

| Action | Description | Arguments |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `interactive` | Launch full-screen fuzzy search UI | None |
| `list` | List all running processes | None |
| `kill-by-name` | Kill processes matching pattern | `<pattern>` `[--force]` |
| `kill-by-pid` | Kill process by ID | `<pid>` `[--force]` |
| `help` | Show help information | None |

## Process Information

Each process entry shows:

- **PID** - Process identifier
- **Name** - Process name/command
- **CPU Usage** - Current CPU consumption (%)
- **Memory** - Memory usage (MB/GB)

## Safety Features

### Confirmation Dialogs

Before terminating processes, you'll see:
- List of processes to be killed
- Option to confirm or cancel
- Clear warning messages

### Protected Processes

Some system-critical processes may be protected by the OS and cannot be killed without elevated permissions.

### Force Kill

The `--force` flag sends:
- **Unix/macOS**: SIGKILL (signal 9) - immediate termination
- **Windows**: `/F` flag - forced termination

Use with caution as force-killed processes cannot clean up resources.

## Platform-Specific Behavior

### macOS/Linux

- Uses `/proc` filesystem for process information (Linux)
- Uses `ps` command for process listing (macOS)
- Sends SIGTERM by default, SIGKILL with `--force`

### Windows

- Uses Windows API for process enumeration
- Terminates with standard close, uses `/F` with `--force`

## Examples

### Find and Kill Memory-Heavy Processes

```bash
# Launch interactive mode
lla plugin kill_process interactive

# Type "chrome" to filter
# Select high-memory instances
# Press Enter to terminate
```

### Kill All Node Processes

```bash
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-name "node"
```

### Force Kill Frozen Application

```bash
# Find the PID first
lla plugin kill_process list | grep "frozen-app"

# Force kill by PID
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-pid 1234 --force
```

### Quick Process Cleanup

```bash
# Create a shortcut
lla shortcut add cleanup kill_process kill-by-name -d "Clean up processes"

# Use it
lla cleanup "electron"
lla cleanup "node"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

If you can't kill a process:
1. Check if it's owned by another user
2. Try with sudo/admin privileges
3. Verify process ID is correct

### Process Not Found

If a process doesn't appear:
1. It may have already terminated
2. Check if running under different user
3. Verify process name spelling

### Force Kill Not Working

If force kill fails:
1. Process may be protected by OS
2. Requires elevated permissions
3. May be a system-critical process

## Best Practices

1. **Use Interactive Mode** - Safer than pattern matching
2. **Verify Before Killing** - Check process details before termination
3. **Avoid Force Kill** - Unless process is truly frozen
4. **Use Specific Patterns** - Avoid overly broad name matches
5. **Create Shortcuts** - For frequently managed processes

## Integration Examples

### With File Operations

```bash
# Kill process using specific file
lla --files-only -f "app.log"  # Find the log
lla kill                        # Kill the app
```

### With Git Workflow

```bash
# Kill development servers before git operations
lla pkill "webpack"
lla pkill "node"
git checkout main
```
