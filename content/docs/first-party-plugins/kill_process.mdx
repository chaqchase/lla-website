# Kill Process Plugin

Interactive process manager that lets you search and terminate processes with a powerful fuzzy search interface.

## Features

- **Live Fuzzy Search** - Real-time filtering that updates as you type
- **Full-Screen Terminal UI** - Instant process filtering with interactive display
- **Arrow Key Navigation** - Navigate through filtered results easily
- **Multi-Select Support** - Select multiple processes to terminate
- **Smart Ranking** - Results ordered by fuzzy match score
- **Process Details** - View PID, name, CPU usage, and memory
- **Force Kill Support** - SIGKILL on Unix, `/F` on Windows
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **High Performance** - Handles 1000+ processes efficiently
- **Safety Confirmations** - Confirmation dialogs before terminating

## Installation

The kill_process plugin is included with lla's first-party plugins:

```bash
lla install
```

Or enable it if already installed:

```bash
lla use  # Interactive plugin manager
```

## Usage

### Interactive Fuzzy Search

Launch the interactive process manager with live fuzzy search:

```bash
lla plugin kill_process kill
```

**Controls:**
- Type to filter processes in real-time
- `↑/↓` - Navigate through results
- `Space` - Select/deselect process for termination
- `Enter` - Confirm selection and return to action menu
- `Esc` - Cancel and exit

The fuzzy search ranks processes by match score, showing the most relevant results first.

### Force Kill (Interactive)

Same interactive experience but uses force kill (SIGKILL/taskkill /F):

```bash
lla plugin kill_process force-kill
```

Use this when processes are frozen and won't respond to normal termination.

### List All Processes

Display all running processes:

```bash
lla plugin kill_process list
```

Shows a formatted table with:
- Process name
- PID
- CPU usage
- Memory usage

### Kill by Name Pattern

Kill processes matching a name pattern:

```bash
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-name chrome
```

Force kill by name:

```bash
lla plugin kill_process force-kill-by-name chrome
```

### Kill by PID

Terminate a specific process ID:

```bash
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-pid 1234
```

Force kill specific PID:

```bash
lla plugin kill_process force-kill-by-pid 1234
```

## Positional Syntax

Use the shorter positional syntax (v0.5.0+):

```bash
# Interactive kill
lla plugin kill_process kill

# Interactive force kill
lla plugin kill_process force-kill

# Kill by name
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-name "node"

# Kill by PID
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-pid 5678
```

## Plugin Aliases

Create a short alias in your config for even faster access:

```toml
# ~/.config/lla/config.toml
[plugin_aliases]
k = "kill_process"
```

Then use:

```bash
lla plugin k kill
lla plugin k force-kill
lla plugin k kill-by-name "firefox"
```

## Shortcuts

Create shortcuts for common process management tasks:

```bash
# Interactive process killer
lla shortcut add kill kill_process kill -d "Kill processes interactively"

# Force kill
lla shortcut add fkill kill_process force-kill -d "Force kill processes"

# Kill by name
lla shortcut add pkill kill_process kill-by-name -d "Kill process by name"
```

Usage:

```bash
lla kill                 # Launch interactive mode
lla fkill                # Launch force kill mode
lla pkill "chrome"       # Kill all Chrome processes
```

## Actions Reference

| Action | Description | Arguments |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `kill` | Interactive fuzzy search to select and kill processes | None |
| `force-kill` | Interactive fuzzy search with force kill (SIGKILL) | None |
| `list` | List all running processes | None |
| `kill-by-name` | Kill processes matching pattern | `<pattern>` |
| `force-kill-by-name` | Force kill processes matching pattern | `<pattern>` |
| `kill-by-pid` | Kill process by ID | `<pid>` |
| `force-kill-by-pid` | Force kill process by ID | `<pid>` |
| `help` | Show help information | None |

## Process Information

Each process entry shows:

- **PID** - Process identifier
- **Name** - Process name/command
- **CPU Usage** - Current CPU consumption (%)
- **Memory** - Memory usage (MB/GB)

## Safety Features

### Confirmation Dialogs

Before terminating processes, you'll see:
- List of selected processes
- Option to confirm or cancel
- Clear warning messages for force kill

### Protected Processes

Some system-critical processes may be protected by the OS and cannot be killed without elevated permissions.

### Force Kill Warning

The force kill actions send:
- **Unix/macOS**: SIGKILL (signal 9) - immediate termination
- **Windows**: `/F` flag - forced termination

Use with caution as force-killed processes cannot clean up resources.

## Platform-Specific Behavior

### macOS/Linux

- Uses process info from system APIs
- Sends SIGTERM (15) by default, SIGKILL (9) for force
- May require sudo for certain processes

### Windows

- Uses Windows API for process enumeration
- Terminates with standard close, uses `/F` with force
- May require Administrator privileges

## Examples

### Interactive Process Management

```bash
# Launch interactive mode
lla plugin kill_process kill

# Type "chrome" to filter Chrome processes
# Use arrow keys to navigate
# Press Space to select multiple processes
# Press Enter to confirm
# Confirm the kill operation
```

### Kill All Node Processes

```bash
lla plugin kill_process kill-by-name "node"
```

### Force Kill Frozen Application

```bash
# Find the PID first
lla plugin kill_process list | grep "frozen-app"

# Force kill by PID
lla plugin kill_process force-kill-by-pid 1234
```

### Quick Workflow with Shortcuts

```bash
# Create shortcuts
lla shortcut add k kill_process kill -d "Kill processes"
lla shortcut add kn kill_process kill-by-name -d "Kill by name"

# Use them
lla k                    # Interactive
lla kn "electron"        # Kill all Electron apps
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied

If you can't kill a process:
1. Check if it's owned by another user
2. Try with sudo/admin privileges
3. Verify process ID is correct

### Process Not Found

If a process doesn't appear:
1. It may have already terminated
2. Check if running under different user
3. Verify process name spelling

### Force Kill Not Working

If force kill fails:
1. Process may be protected by OS
2. Requires elevated permissions
3. May be a system-critical process

## Best Practices

1. **Use Interactive Mode** - Safer than pattern matching
2. **Verify Before Killing** - Check process details before termination
3. **Avoid Force Kill** - Unless process is truly frozen
4. **Use Specific Patterns** - Avoid overly broad name matches
5. **Create Shortcuts** - For frequently managed processes
