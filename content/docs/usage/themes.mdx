# Crafting Your Perfect Theme

lla's theming system empowers you to create a file explorer that matches your aesthetic preferences and enhances your workflow. Through thoughtfully designed TOML configuration files, you can customize every aspect of your file listings, from basic colors to intricate pattern matching.

## Theme Organization

Your themes live in `~/.config/lla/themes/` with a `.toml` extension:

```
~/.config/lla/themes/
├── dark.toml
├── light.toml
├── poimandres.toml
└── custom.toml
```

## Themes Installation

lla ships with a default theme collection, you can pull all builtin themes with the following command:

```bash
lla theme pull # pull all builtin themes
```

you can also install custom themes using the following command:

```bash
lla theme install /path/to/theme.toml
# or a directory with multiple themes
lla theme install /path/to/themes/
```

## Theme Architecture

Every theme consists of carefully organized sections:

```toml
# Theme metadata
name = "my_theme"
author = "Your Name"
description = "A description of your theme"

# Core colors for basic elements
[colors]
file = "#FFFFFF"
directory = "#89AFFF"
...

# Special file rules
[special_files]
...

# Extension-based colors
[extensions]
...
```

## Color Expression

lla embraces flexibility in color definition:

```toml
[colors]
# 1. Named Colors (Basic terminal colors)
file = "white"
directory = "blue"
symlink = "bright_cyan"

# 2. RGB Format
file = { r = 255, g = 255, b = 255 }
directory = { r = 81, g = 154, b = 255 }

# 3. Hex Format
file = "#FFFFFF"              # 6-digit hex
directory = "#89F"           # 3-digit hex
symlink = "#89DBFFFF"       # 8-digit hex (alpha ignored)

# 4. HSL Format (h: 0-360, s: 0-1, l: 0-1)
directory = { h = 180, s = 0.5, l = 0.6 }

# 5. No Color
disabled = "none"
```

### Available Named Colors

Basic Colors:

- `black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `white`

Bright Variants:

- `bright_black` (or `gray`/`grey`)
- `bright_red`, `bright_green`, `bright_yellow`
- `bright_blue`, `bright_magenta`, `bright_cyan`, `bright_white`

Additional Colors:

- `navy`, `teal`, `maroon`, `purple`, `olive`, `silver`

## Core Elements

Define your foundation colors:

```toml
[colors]
# Core UI Elements
file = "#FFFFFF"        # Regular files
directory = "#89AFFF"   # Directories
symlink = "#89DBFF"     # Symbolic links
executable = "#5DE4B3"  # Executable files

# Metadata
size = "#5DE4B3"       # File sizes
date = "#FCBCFA"       # Timestamps
user = "#D0679D"       # User names
group = "#8A9092"      # Group names

# Permissions
permission_dir = "#89AFFF"   # Directory permission
permission_read = "#5DE4B3"  # Read permission
permission_write = "#FFFFC2" # Write permission
permission_exec = "#D0679D"  # Execute permission
permission_none = "#282E30"  # No permission
```

## Special File Handling

Create sophisticated rules for specific files and patterns:

### 1. Custom Folders

```toml
[special_files.folders]
# Exact folder names
"node_modules" = "#666666"  # Dim gray for node modules
"target" = "#444444"        # Dark gray for build outputs
".git" = "#FF6B6B"          # Red for git directory

# Folder patterns
"build*" = "#444444"        # Any folder starting with "build"
"*.cache" = "#666666"       # Any folder ending with ".cache"
"*-env" = "#5DE4B3"        # Any folder ending with "-env"
```

### 2. Dotfiles

```toml
[special_files.dotfiles]
".gitignore" = "#89DBFF"
".env" = "#FFFFC2"
".dockerignore" = "#89DBFF"
```

### 3. Exact Matches

```toml
[special_files.exact_match]
"Dockerfile" = "#89DBFF"
"Makefile" = "#D0679D"
"README.md" = "#FFFFC2"
```

### 4. Pattern Matches

```toml
[special_files.patterns]
"*rc" = "#89DBFF"         # Files ending in "rc"
"*.min.*" = "#282E30"     # Minified files
"*.test.*" = "#5DE4B3"    # Test files
```

## Extension System

Create logical groups of related file types:

### 1. Extension Groups

```toml
[extensions.groups]
# Group multiple extensions
rust = ["rs", "toml"]
web = ["html", "css", "js"]
docs = ["md", "rst", "txt"]

# Define colors for groups
[extensions.colors]
rust = "#FF5733"    # All rust-related files
web = "#61AFEF"     # All web files
docs = "#98C379"    # All documentation files

# Override specific extensions
rs = "#FF0000"      # Override just .rs files
```

## Color Resolution Logic

lla follows a careful priority system when determining colors:

1. For Directories:
   - Exact folder name match
   - Folder pattern match
   - Default directory color

2. For Files:
   - Exact filename match
   - Dotfile match
   - Pattern match
   - Extension-specific color
   - Extension group color
   - Default file color

# Theme Application

Apply your chosen theme through configuration, the chosen theme should be available in the `~/.config/lla/themes/` directory:

```toml
# In ~/.config/lla/config.toml
theme = "dark"  # Without .toml extension
```

Or via command line:

```bash
# use the lla theme command for an interactive selection
lla theme

# or via config
lla config --set theme dark
```

Disable theming when needed:

```bash
lla config --set theme none
```

For a completely color-free experience:

```bash
lla --no-colors # works with all listing commands
```
