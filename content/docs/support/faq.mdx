# Frequently Asked Questions

Quick answers to common questions about lla. Can't find what you're looking for? Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/support/troubleshooting) or [open an issue](https://github.com/chaqchase/lla/issues).

## General Questions

### What is lla?

lla is a modern file listing tool that enhances the traditional `ls` command with multiple views, powerful filtering, Git integration, and an extensible plugin system. It's written in Rust for optimal performance and reliability.

### Why choose lla over ls or exa?

lla offers several advantages:

- **Multiple specialized views**: Tree, grid, table, timeline, sizemap, and more
- **Plugin system**: Extend functionality without modifying core code
- **Git integration**: Native repository status in your listings
- **Content search**: Ripgrep-powered search across file contents
- **Modern design**: Beautiful output with theme support
- **Active development**: Regular updates and new features

### Is lla free?

Yes! lla is open-source software licensed under the MIT License. It's free to use, modify, and distribute.

### What platforms does lla support?

lla works on:
- **Linux** (x86_64, ARM64)
- **macOS** (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- **Windows** (via WSL)

Native Windows support is planned for future releases.

## Installation & Setup

### How do I install lla?

The quickest method is using the installation script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaqchase/lla/main/install.sh | bash
```

See the [Installation Guide](/docs/about/installation) for other methods including package managers and building from source.

### Why can't I find lla after installation?

The installation directory might not be in your PATH. Add it:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

# Make it permanent
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Do I need to configure lla before using it?

No! lla works perfectly out of the box with sensible defaults. However, you can customize it by running:

```bash
lla init    # Creates ~/.config/lla/config.toml
```

### How do I uninstall lla?

```bash
# Remove the binary
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/lla

# Remove configuration (optional)
rm -rf ~/.config/lla
```

## Usage

### Why are icons not displaying correctly?

Icons require a Nerd Font. Install one from [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), configure your terminal to use it, and restart your terminal.

Popular choices:
- FiraCode Nerd Font
- JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
- Hack Nerd Font

### Can I use lla as a drop-in replacement for ls?

Yes! Create an alias in your shell configuration:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias ls='lla'
alias ll='lla -l'
```

### How do I exclude hidden files?

Use the `--no-dotfiles` flag:

```bash
lla --no-dotfiles
```

Or set it as default in your config:

```toml
[filter]
no_dotfiles = true
```

### What's the difference between -R and -t?

- **`-R` (recursive)**: Lists all files in subdirectories in a flat format
- **`-t` (tree)**: Shows hierarchical directory structure with indentation

Both support depth limiting with `-d`:
```bash
lla -R -d 2    # Recursive, 2 levels deep
lla -t -d 2    # Tree view, 2 levels deep
```

### Can lla list archive contents?

Yes! lla can list contents of zip, tar, and tar.gz archives without extraction:

```bash
lla archive.zip -t       # Tree view of archive
lla project.tar.gz -l    # Long format of archive contents
```

## Plugins

### How do I install plugins?

Install all first-party plugins:

```bash
lla install
```

Install from a Git repository:

```bash
lla install --git https://github.com/username/plugin-repo
```

Install from a local directory:

```bash
lla install --dir /path/to/plugin
```

### Do I need Rust to install plugins?

Yes, currently plugins need to be built from source, which requires Rust. Install it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

Pre-built plugin binaries are planned for future releases.

### How do I enable/disable plugins?

Interactive mode:
```bash
lla use    # Navigate with arrow keys, toggle with space
```

Command line:
```bash
lla --enable-plugin plugin_name
lla --disable-plugin plugin_name
```

### Where are plugins stored?

Default location: `~/.config/lla/plugins/`

You can customize this in your config:

```toml
plugins_dir = "~/custom/plugin/path"
```

### Can I write plugins in other languages?

Currently, plugins must be written in Rust. However, the Protocol Buffer-based interface is language-agnostic, so support for other languages is theoretically possible in the future.

### How do I create a plugin?

Follow our comprehensive [Plugin Development Tutorial](/docs/guides/plugin-development-tutorial) which walks you through creating your first plugin step-by-step.

### Do plugins slow down lla?

Disabled plugins have zero performance impact. Enabled plugins only run when needed, and lla's architecture ensures they can't significantly slow down listings.

## Performance

### Is lla slower than ls?

For small directories, lla and ls perform similarly. For large directories, lla's Rust implementation and optimized algorithms often match or exceed ls performance, while providing much more information.

### Why is lla slow on my large directory?

A few possible reasons:

1. **Directory size calculation**: Use `--no-dirs` to skip this expensive operation
2. **Deep recursion**: Limit depth with `-d 3`
3. **Plugin overhead**: Disable unused plugins with `lla use`
4. **Network filesystems**: These are inherently slower; consider using filters to reduce output

Adjust performance limits in your config:

```toml
[formatters.tree]
max_lines = 10000

[listers.recursive]
max_entries = 10000
```

### Can I speed up Git status?

Git status checks can be slow in large repositories. Disable Git integration when not needed:

```bash
lla         # Without Git status
lla -G      # With Git status (only when needed)
```

### Why is the first run slow?

The first run may need to:
- Load and verify plugins
- Generate configuration
- Cache Git repository information

Subsequent runs should be much faster due to caching.

## Customization

### How do I change colors?

lla uses themes. Switch themes:

```bash
lla theme              # Interactive theme selector
```

Or edit your config:

```toml
theme = "dark"
```

Available themes include: default, dark, light, dracula, nord, gruvbox_dark, and many more.

### Can I create my own theme?

Yes! Create a TOML file in `~/.config/lla/themes/`:

```toml
name = "my_theme"
author = "Your Name"
description = "My custom theme"

[colors]
file = "#FFFFFF"
directory = "#89AFFF"
# ... more colors
```

See the [Themes Guide](/docs/usage/themes) for complete documentation.

### How do I change the default view?

Edit your config:

```toml
default_format = "long"    # Options: default, long, tree, grid, table
```

### Can I set defaults for flags?

Yes, in your config:

```toml
show_icons = true
default_sort = "size"
default_depth = 3

[sort]
dirs_first = true
case_sensitive = false

[filter]
no_dotfiles = true
```

## Machine Output

### What output formats does lla support?

lla supports three machine-readable formats:

- **JSON**: `lla --json` (add `--pretty` for formatted output)
- **NDJSON**: `lla --ndjson` (newline-delimited JSON)
- **CSV**: `lla --csv`

### How do I use lla output in scripts?

JSON example with jq:

```bash
# Get all .rs files larger than 1KB
lla --json | jq '[.[] | select(.extension == "rs" and .size_bytes > 1024)]'

# Export file sizes to CSV
lla --csv > files.csv
```

NDJSON for streaming:

```bash
# Process large directories line-by-line
lla --ndjson | while read -r line; do
  echo "$line" | jq '.name'
done
```

### Is the output format stable?

Yes! The machine output format is versioned and stable. We guarantee backward compatibility and announce any changes in advance.

## Git Integration

### Does lla require Git?

No, Git integration is optional. If Git is not installed or you're not in a repository, lla works normally without Git features.

### Why isn't Git status showing?

Possible reasons:

1. Not in a Git repository: `git status` to verify
2. Git not installed: Install Git for your platform
3. Git view not active: Use `lla -G` to enable Git view

### Can I see untracked files?

Yes! The Git view shows:
- Modified files
- Staged files
- Untracked files
- Conflicts
- Branch and commit information

```bash
lla -G    # Git view with full status
```

## Troubleshooting

### lla crashes when I run it

1. Check your lla version: `lla --version`
2. Update to the latest version
3. Disable plugins: `lla --disable-all-plugins`
4. Check for file permission issues
5. Report the issue with crash details

### Output looks corrupted

This usually indicates a terminal compatibility issue:

1. Ensure your terminal supports Unicode
2. Check that your font supports special characters
3. Try disabling icons: `lla --no-icons`
4. Try disabling colors: `lla --no-colors`

### Fuzzy search isn't working

Fuzzy search is experimental and requires:

1. lla version 0.2.0 or later
2. Sufficient terminal size
3. Working terminal input

Try: `lla --fuzzy` in a test directory.

### Plugins fail to load

Check:

1. Plugin file has correct extension (.so, .dylib, or .dll)
2. Plugin has execute permissions: `chmod +x plugin.so`
3. Plugin is in the correct directory: `~/.config/lla/plugins/`
4. Run `lla clean` to remove invalid plugins
