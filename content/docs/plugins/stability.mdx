# Building for Longevity: ABI Stability

At the heart of lla's plugin ecosystem lies a thoughtfully designed ABI (Application Binary Interface) stability system. This foundation ensures your plugins remain reliable across lla versions and Rust compiler updates, providing a stable platform for extending lla's capabilities.

## Core Architecture

### Message-Based Foundation

We've chosen Protocol Buffers as our communication backbone, creating a robust bridge between lla and its plugins:

```protobuf
message PluginMessage {
    oneof message {
        bool get_name = 1;
        bool get_version = 2;
        bool get_description = 3;
        // ... other fields
    }
}
```

This approach delivers three key benefits:
- Freedom from Rust ABI constraints
- Language-neutral communication
- Version resilience

### Cross-Language Communication

Our FFI layer speaks a universal language through C-compatible types:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
pub struct RawBuffer {
    pub ptr: *mut u8,
    pub len: usize,
    pub capacity: usize,
}

#[repr(C)]
pub struct PluginApi {
    pub version: u32,
    pub handle_request: extern "C" fn(*mut std::ffi::c_void, *const u8, usize) -> RawBuffer,
    pub free_response: extern "C" fn(*mut RawBuffer),
}
```

### Version Intelligence

Every plugin carries its identity:

```rust
pub const CURRENT_PLUGIN_API_VERSION: u32 = 1;
```

The system actively verifies version compatibility during loading, preventing unexpected behavior.

## Data Interchange

### Rich Metadata Exchange

File information flows through a carefully structured Protocol Buffer format:

```protobuf
message EntryMetadata {
    uint64 size = 1;
    uint64 modified = 2;
    uint64 accessed = 3;
    uint64 created = 4;
    bool is_dir = 5;
    bool is_file = 6;
    bool is_symlink = 7;
    uint32 permissions = 8;
    uint32 uid = 9;
    uint32 gid = 10;
}
```

### Extensible Design

Plugins can enrich entries with their own insights:

```protobuf
message DecoratedEntry {
    string path = 1;
    EntryMetadata metadata = 2;
    map<string, string> custom_fields = 3;
}
```

## Implementation Intelligence

### Smart Plugin Loading

Our system leverages `libloading` for dynamic plugin management:
- Isolated plugin environments
- Message-based communication
- Safe memory boundaries

### Type Safety Guarantees

We ensure reliability through:
- Rigorous Protocol Buffer schemas
- FFI-compatible type systems
- Clear conversion pathways

## Creating Plugins

Building a plugin? Here's your path to success:

1. Start with our FFI macros:
   ```rust
   declare_plugin!(MyPlugin);
   ```

2. Implement core functionality:
   ```rust
   impl Plugin for MyPlugin {
       fn handle_raw_request(&mut self, request: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
           // Transform requests into responses
       }
   }
   ```

3. Handle data transformations:
   ```rust
   impl From<EntryMetadata> for proto::EntryMetadata {
       fn from(meta: EntryMetadata) -> Self {
           // Convert your data structures
       }
   }
   ```

You can use our [plugin utils](https://github.com/triyanox/lla/tree/main/lla_plugin_utils) which abstracts away the verbosity of the plugin interface implementation. View the other [plugins](https://github.com/triyanox/lla/tree/main/plugins) for more examples.
