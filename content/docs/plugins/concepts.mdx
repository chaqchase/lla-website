# Extending lla's Capabilities

The heart of lla's extensibility lies in its thoughtfully designed plugin system. Built on a foundation of version independence and robust message passing, this architecture lets you enhance and customize lla while maintaining stability and performance.

## Core Design

Our plugin system leverages Protocol Buffers to create a reliable, version-agnostic communication layer. This thoughtful approach ensures:

- Isolated execution for stability and security
- Seamless compatibility across lla versions
- Consistent interface for developers
- Sophisticated data handling capabilities

## Getting Started

Add new capabilities to your lla installation:

```bash
# Install plugins
lla install --git https://github.com/user/plugin     # From Git repository
lla install --dir path/to/plugin                     # From local directory

# Manage your plugins
lla use                    # Interactive management
lla --enable-plugin name   # Enable functionality
lla --disable-plugin name  # Disable when needed
```

## Plugin Organization

Your plugins reside in:
- Standard path: `~/.config/lla/plugins`
- Custom location: Define via `plugins_dir` in config

## Keeping Current

Maintain your plugins' health:

```bash
lla update                 # Refresh all plugins
lla update plugin_name     # Update specific functionality
```

## Enhancement Categories

Plugins can transform lla in three key areas:

1. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Custom view formats
   - Enhanced information display
   - Visual styling options

2. **Tool Integration**
   - Version control awareness
   - External tool connectivity
   - Custom file handlers

3. **Command Extensions**
   - New functionality
   - Custom operations
   - Workflow automation

## Plugin Management

Fine-tune your plugin setup through configuration:

```toml
# In ~/.config/lla/config.toml

# Active plugins
enabled_plugins = ["git_status", "file_hash"]

# Custom plugin location
plugins_dir = "~/custom/plugin/path"
```
