# Installation

Getting lla up and running is quick and straightforward. Choose the installation method that best fits your workflow.

## Quick Install (Recommended)

The easiest way to install lla is using our automated installation script, which handles platform detection and verification:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaqchase/lla/main/install.sh | bash
```

**What this script does:**

- Automatically detects your operating system and CPU architecture
- Downloads the appropriate pre-compiled binary for your platform
- Verifies the integrity of the download using checksums
- Installs lla to `/usr/local/bin` (requires sudo on some systems)
- Sets proper executable permissions

**Supported platforms:**

- Linux (x86_64, ARM64)
- macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- Windows (via WSL)

## Install from Cargo

If you have Rust's package manager `cargo` installed, you can build and install lla from source:

```bash
cargo install lla
```

This method:
- Compiles lla specifically for your system
- Always gives you the latest stable release from crates.io
- Installs to `~/.cargo/bin` (ensure it's in your PATH)

**Note:** Building from source requires a Rust toolchain. Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) if needed.

## Package Managers

lla is available through several package managers for convenient installation and automatic updates:

<Default items={[`lla`]} />

**Platform-specific commands:**

| Platform | Package Manager | Command |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| macOS | Homebrew | `brew install lla` |
| Arch Linux | paru | `paru -S lla` |
| NetBSD | pkgin | `pkgin install lla` |
| Cross-platform | X-CMD | `x install lla` |
| Any with Cargo | cargo | `cargo install lla` |

## Manual Installation

Download pre-built binaries from our [releases page](https://github.com/chaqchase/lla/releases):

> **Note:** Replace `<version>` with the latest version tag from the [releases page](https://github.com/chaqchase/lla/releases). e.g. `v0.3.8`

### Linux (x86_64)
```bash
wget -c https://github.com/chaqchase/lla/releases/download/<version>/lla-linux-amd64 -O lla
sudo chmod +x lla
sudo chown root:root lla
sudo mv lla /usr/local/bin/lla
```

### Linux (ARM64)
```bash
wget -c https://github.com/chaqchase/lla/releases/download/<version>/lla-linux-arm64 -O lla
sudo chmod +x lla
sudo chown root:root lla
sudo mv lla /usr/local/bin/lla
```

### macOS (x86_64)
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/chaqchase/lla/releases/download/<version>/lla-darwin-amd64 -o lla
sudo chmod +x lla
sudo chown root:wheel lla
sudo mv lla /usr/local/bin/lla
```

### macOS (ARM64)
```bash
curl -L https://github.com/chaqchase/lla/releases/download/<version>/lla-darwin-arm64 -o lla
sudo chmod +x lla
sudo chown root:wheel lla
sudo mv lla /usr/local/bin/lla
```

# Post-Installation Setup

After installing lla, follow these steps to complete your setup and verify everything works correctly.

## 1. Verify Installation

Confirm lla is installed and accessible:

```bash
lla --version
```

You should see output similar to:
```
lla 0.3.9
```

If you see "command not found", ensure the installation directory is in your PATH:

```bash
# For manual installations
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

# For cargo installations
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

## 2. Shell Completion (Highly Recommended)

Enable tab completion for your shell to dramatically improve your lla workflow:

### Bash

```bash
# Generate completion script
lla completion bash > ~/.lla-completion.bash

# Add to your ~/.bashrc
echo 'source ~/.lla-completion.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Zsh

```bash
# Generate completion script
lla completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_lla

# Add to your ~/.zshrc (if not already present)
echo 'fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'autoload -Uz compinit && compinit' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Fish

```bash
# Generate and install completion
lla completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/lla.fish
```

### Elvish

```bash
# Generate completion
lla completion elvish > ~/.elvish/lib/lla-completion.elv

# Add to your ~/.elvish/rc.elv
echo 'use lla-completion' >> ~/.elvish/rc.elv
```

## 3. Initialize Configuration

Create your configuration file with sensible defaults:

```bash
lla init
```

This creates `~/.config/lla/config.toml` with default settings. You can view it anytime:

```bash
lla config              # View your configuration
```

To customize settings, either edit the file directly or use the config command:

```bash
# View current theme
lla config --get theme

# Change theme
lla config --set theme dark

# Enable icons by default
lla config --set show_icons true
```

## 4. Install Plugins (Optional)

Enhance lla with plugins for additional functionality:

```bash
# Install all first-party plugins
lla install

# Or install specific plugins from Git
lla install --git https://github.com/chaqchase/lla-plugin-name
```

Learn more about plugins in the [Plugin System](/docs/plugins/concepts) documentation.

## Quick Test

Try these commands to see lla in action:

```bash
lla                    # List current directory
lla -l                 # Long format with details
lla -t                 # Tree view
lla --fuzzy            # Interactive fuzzy search
```

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found" Error

**Problem:** Shell cannot find lla after installation.

**Solution:** Add the installation directory to your PATH:

```bash
# Check where lla is installed
which lla

# If in /usr/local/bin, add to PATH
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"

# Make it permanent (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Permission Denied

**Problem:** Cannot execute lla after manual installation.

**Solution:** Ensure the binary has execute permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lla
```

### Checksum Verification Failed

**Problem:** Installation script reports checksum mismatch.

**Solution:** This usually indicates a corrupted download. Try again:

```bash
# Clear any partial downloads
rm -f /tmp/lla-*

# Run installation script again
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chaqchase/lla/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Icons Not Displaying

**Problem:** File icons appear as squares or question marks.

**Solution:** Install a Nerd Font and configure your terminal to use it:

1. Download a Nerd Font from [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
2. Install the font on your system
3. Configure your terminal emulator to use the Nerd Font
4. Restart your terminal

Popular choices: FiraCode Nerd Font, JetBrainsMono Nerd Font, Hack Nerd Font

### Slow Performance on Large Directories

**Problem:** lla is slow when listing directories with many files.

**Solution:** Adjust performance settings in your config:

```toml
# In ~/.config/lla/config.toml
[formatters.tree]
max_lines = 10000     # Reduce from default 20000

[listers.recursive]
max_entries = 10000   # Reduce from default 20000

# Disable directory size calculation
include_dirs = false
```
