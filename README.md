This is the official documentation website for `lla` - a modern, fast file explorer built in Rust that enhances the traditional ls command with powerful features like plugins, specialized views, and Git integration.

## About LLA

LLA is more than just another `ls` replacement â€“ it's a thoughtfully crafted terminal file explorer that transforms how developers interact with their filesystem. Built with Rust's performance capabilities and designed with user experience in mind, LLA strikes a careful balance between power and simplicity.
